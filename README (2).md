# HRAnalytics Absenteesim


HR is not just about hiring people it is an ocean of its own. HR department goes through a constant journey of finding, selecting, onboarding and monitoring the right talent. We are required to use analytics concept to provide a smooth monitoring of workforce for the HR department. This data set is suitable for identifying pockets of absence in the organization. These pockets may require interventions. â€˜AbsentHourâ€™ will be used as a dependent variable. In addition, age and length of service may also be associated with absence.
The main aim of the project is to perform data visualization techniques to understand the insight of the absenteeism data. This project aims apply various Business Intelligence tools such as Power BI to get a visual understanding of the data.
